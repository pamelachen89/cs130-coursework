            <h2>Musicians</h2>
                <p>I love Taylor Swift, Mitski, Lorde, Sabrina Carpenter, and Olivia Rodrigo. As you can probably tell,
                    I love girl pop/alt! Also have actually been really digging Maggie Rogers lately.</p>
                <p>My freshman year of high school, I had a huge emo phase, so I listened to a ton of My Chemical Romance, Panic! at the Disco,
                    and Twenty One Pilots. Honestly, some of those songs still stick around on my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1235560879?si=7f3037fd4dbf4c96">playlists</a> to this day.
                </p>
                <p>I also really enjoy some other artists in scattered genres, including Joji, the Wallows, Hippo Campus, and Still Woozy.</p>

            <h2>Songs</h2>

                    </ul>
                <p>I'm a little embarassed about the Joshua Bassett, I will admit... but hey sometimes we have moments of weakness...

            <h2>Movies</h2>
                <p>You can check out my letterboxd <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pc925/">here</a>, where I've logged, reviewed,
                    and rated all the movies I've watched during spring break and spring quarter. some of my favorites, though, include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>clueless (1995) <i>dir. amy heckerling</i></li>
                        <li>pride and prejudice (2005) <i>dir. joe wright</i></li>
                        <li>the social network (2010) <i>dir. david fincher</i></li>
                        <li>your name (2016) <i>dir. makoto shinkai</i></li>
                        <li>scott pilgrim vs. the world (2010) <i>dir. edgar wright</i></li>
                    </ul>
                <p>I'm really big on rom-coms and chick flicks, which is probably sort of evident by the majority of that list.</p>

            <h2>TV Shows</h2>
                <p>I actually don't watch that much TV because I prefer movies, but recently I've been working through the
                    boku no hero academia anime. I'm eagerly anticipating new seasons of the crown, stranger things, never have i ever,
                and haikyuu!</p>
